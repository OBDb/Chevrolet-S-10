generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1982
    end_year: 1993
    description: "The original Chevrolet S-10 was GM's first domestically produced compact pickup truck, developed to compete with the increasingly popular Japanese compact trucks. Available in regular and extended cab configurations with various bed lengths, it offered a range of four-cylinder and V6 engines, including a 2.8L V6 and later a 4.3L V6. Four-wheel drive was optional, making it capable in off-road conditions. Special editions included the sport-oriented Tahoe package (before Tahoe became a separate SUV model) and the high-performance S-10 Blazer. A significant refresh in 1989 updated the styling and interior. This generation established the S-10 as a major player in the compact truck market and provided the foundation for the S-10 Blazer SUV derivative."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 1994
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The redesigned S-10 featured more modern styling and improved engineering. Available in regular cab, extended cab, and for the first time, crew cab configurations (the latter primarily in international markets), it offered more interior space and comfort features. Engine options continued with four-cylinder and V6 choices, with the 4.3L V6 as the primary powerplant for most of its production. Special models included the sport-oriented SS variant and the off-road-focused ZR2 with increased ground clearance, wider track, and enhanced suspension. Safety features improved with the addition of driver and later passenger airbags. The second-generation S-10 continued as a popular choice in the compact truck segment until it was replaced by the larger Colorado for the 2004 model year in North America. In international markets, particularly Brazil and other South American countries, the S-10 name continued on subsequent generations developed specifically for those regions."

  - name: "Third Generation (International Markets)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2023
    description: "In many international markets, particularly South America, the S-10 nameplate continued on an entirely different vehicle than the North American Colorado. This generation was based on the Isuzu D-Max/Chevrolet Colorado developed for global markets, featuring more rugged styling and capability focused on developing markets. Available primarily in extended and crew cab configurations, it was powered by gasoline and diesel engines depending on the market, with the 2.8L Duramax diesel being popular for its torque and efficiency. Four-wheel drive variants offered significant off-road capability, important for the rural and undeveloped areas where these trucks often operated. The interior combined durability with increasingly modern technology as the generation progressed through updates. This generation maintained the S-10's position as a core model in Chevrolet's truck lineup in South America while North America used the Colorado name for its mid-size pickup offerings."
